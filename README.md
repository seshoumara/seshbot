# seshbot

Custom Twitch chat bot written in Node.js, for personal use.

## Available commands:

- static: !itch, !LLH, !jam, !discord (these commands moved from code to JSON file, to edit/add new ones much easier)
- automatic: !bot
- text to speech: !tts <test>
- Faeria: !tournament, !players
- Twitch (restricted): !so <streamer>, !raid <streamer> (streamer data moved from code to JSON file, to edit it much easier)
